        <p>
          Surabaya is Indonesia's second-largest city and the capital of East Java. Known as <em>Kota Pahlawan</em>
          (City of Heroes), it played a pivotal role in Indonesia's independence struggle. Today it's a
          busy port city—centered around Tanjung Perak—mixing historic districts, riverside promenades,
          and modern business hubs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The climate is warm and humid year-round, perfect for night markets and street food adventures.
          Landmarks include Tugu Pahlawan, the Suramadu Bridge, old Arab and Chinatown quarters, and the
          Submarine Monument along the Kalimas River.
